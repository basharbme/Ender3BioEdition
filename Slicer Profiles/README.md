# How To Import Slicer Settings (PrusaSlicer)

1. Install PrusaSlicer from this link (https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/) if you do not already have it installed. Follow the steps of the installation wizard until the slicer program is installed.

2. Once installed, an initial configuration setup window will popup asking you to select your printer. Feel free to hit "Cancel" and ignore this.

3. Download the "Prusaslicer_config_bundle" file from this folder.

4. On PrusaSlicer, select File > Import > Import Config Bundle... and select the "Prusaslicer_config_bundle" file that you downloaded from this repo. 

5. You're done! The Bioprinter slicer settings should be imported!
