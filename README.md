# Ender-3: Bioprinter Edition! (work in progress)
Original authors: Joongho Kim, Elisa Dorn, Saad Kamal, Jasmeet Mander

# The Problem:
Bioprinters are a recent emerging biofabrication technology that is capable of printing various complex biological structures (such as tissue or organs) through a layer-by-layer additive process (similar to traditional 3D printers!). Unfortunately, (unlike traditional 3D printers) bioprinters are expensive, and many university/college bio laboratories do not have access to one.  

# The Goal:
Convert the Ender-3 into a low-cost bioprinter, capable of extruding viscous bioinks. While bioprinters are still a rarity, many educational/research institutions have access to many "traditional" 3D printers. So by making a majority of the build parts "3D-printable" and also centering our modifications around a "budget" 3D printer, we hope to make this project accessible to as many people as possible. We hope to make bioprinters a part of many more laboratories and research facilities all over the world, and encourage further research in the field!
